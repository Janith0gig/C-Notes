Loops in C++

Loops in C++ are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. They help in manage repetitive tasks.

1. For loop: Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
2. While loop : Used when number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on condition.
3. Do-While loop : Similar to the while loop, but guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once before checking the condition.

example -->
For loop
// Printing numbers 1 to 5 using loop
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
  for (int i=1; i <= 5; i++)
  {
      cout<<i<<endl;
  }
    return 0;
}

While loop

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    int i=1;
    
    while ( i<=5 )
    {
        cout<<i<<endl;
        i++;
    }    
    return 0;
}
